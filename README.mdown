# jcukeforker

Forking cukes and VNC displays.

Jcukeforker is a fork of cukeforker desgined for jruby.

### NB!

If you're using cukeforker with selenium-webdriver and Firefox, all versions prior to 2.40 has a bug where custom
Firefox profiles created in a forked process would not get cleaned up. Please make sure you're using selenium-webdriver >= 2.40
to avoid this.

## Usage


```ruby
    # parallelize per feature
    JCukeForker::Runner.run Dir['features/**/*.feature'],
                           :max        => 4                     # number of workers
                           :out        => "/path/to/reports",   # output path
                           :format     => :html                 # passed to `cucumber --format`,
                           :extra_args => %w[--extra arguments] # passed to cucumber,
                           :vnc        => true                  # manage a pool of VNC displays, assign one per worker.

    # parallelize per scenario, with one JUnit XML file per scenario.
    JCukeForker::Runner.run JCukeForker::Scenarios.tagged(%W[@edition ~@wip])
                           :extra_args => %W[-f CukeForker::Formatters::JunitScenarioFormatter --out results/junit]
```

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
